## My Tech Stack

Here are some of the technologies and tools I work with:

- **Programming Languages**: Python(Matplotlib, NumPy), JavaScript, Java, C++
- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Version Control**: Git, Gitlab
- **IDEs**: Visual Studio Code, Notepad++, Atom, PyCharm
- **Other Tools**: Jupyter, Google Collab, MATLAB, Wolfram Mathematica

## Projects

I love to code and create interesting projects. Here are a few noteworthy ones:

- [Young's Double Slit Simulator](https://github.com/jyotiraj-code/double-slit-simulator): It simulates the Young's Double Slit experiment, which forms the basis for the study of Quantum Mechanics.
- [Monte Carlo Simulations](https://github.com/jyotiraj-code/monte-carlo): This repo contains the basic monte carlo simulations which are essential in physics and mathematics.
- [Lorenz System](https://github.com/jyotiraj-code/lorenz-system): This project contains the simulation of the Lornez Attractor which is famously called as the butterfly effect simulation.

## Blog

I occasionally write articles on my blog regarding quantum computing and related tech. Here are some recent posts:

- [Simplifying Quantum Mechanics with Bra-Ket Notation (with codes)](https://medium.com/@jyotirajnath7/simplifying-quantum-mechanics-with-bra-ket-notation-with-codes-17584c7282e2): Here I discussed about the bra and ket notations for the formalization of quantum mechanics and the different operations of the notations.
- [Article 2](link-to-article-2): Another interesting post.
- [Article 3](link-to-article-3): And more insights into the tech world.
